## 🎉 Fix Status

### ✅ **MULTIPLE SERVICE SELECTION BUG FIXED**

**Before the fix:**
- ❌ Providers only received leads for one service
- ❌ Service objects and JSON field were not synced
- ❌ Lead filtering only used incomplete JSON field

**After the fix:**
- ✅ Providers receive leads for ALL their selected services
- ✅ Service objects and JSON field are automatically synced
- ✅ Lead filtering uses properly synced service categories
- ✅ Multiple service selection works correctly

## 🚀 Technical Implementation

**Files Modified:**
- `backend/users/services_views.py` - Added sync function
- Deployed to production server

**Key Function Added:**
```python
def _sync_service_categories_json_field(provider_profile):
    """Sync service_categories JSON field with Service objects"""
    # Gets all active service category slugs from Service objects
    # Updates JSON field to match Service objects
    # Ensures consistency for lead filtering
```

## 📈 Next Steps

1. **Monitor provider dashboards** for lead distribution
2. **Verify yusuf jack receives leads for all his services**
3. **Test with additional providers** if needed
4. **Monitor system performance** with multiple service matching
