## 🏦 Payment Reference System Explained

### How It Works

The system uses **TWO types of references**:

#### 1. Customer Code (Unique Per Provider)
- **MISHECK NDOLO's Code**: **XJO71P**
- **Purpose**: Identifies the provider making the payment
- **Generated**: Automatically when provider profile is created
- **Format**: 6-character alphanumeric code
- **Usage**: Provider uses **PCXJO71P** as bank reference

#### 2. Reference Number (Unique Per Deposit)
- **Current Deposit**: **MISHECK001**
- **Purpose**: Identifies individual deposit transactions
- **Generated**: For each new deposit request
- **Format**: Provider name + sequential number
- **Usage**: Internal tracking and reconciliation

- R150 = 3 credits ✅ (MISHECK NDOLO's deposit)
- R500 = 10 credits
- R1000 = 20 credits

```

## 📊 System Architecture

### Database Structure
```
ProviderProfile
├── customer_code: XJO71P (unique per provider)
└── user → User

DepositRequest
├── reference_number: MISHECK001 (unique per deposit)
├── customer_code: XJO71P (links to provider)
├── amount: R150.00
├── credits_to_activate: 3
└── status: verified

### Reference Generation

#### Customer Code Generation
```python
def generate_customer_code(self):
    """Generate 6-character alphanumeric code"""
    while True:
        code = ''.join(random.choices(string.ascii_uppercase + string.digits, k=6))
        if not ProviderProfile.objects.filter(customer_code=code).exists():
            return code
```

#### Deposit Reference Generation
```python
# Format: PC + last 3 chars of customer code + deposit count
reference_number = f"PC{provider.customer_code[-3:]}{DepositRequest.objects.count() + 1:03d}"
# OR
# Format: Provider name + sequential number
reference_number = "MISHECK001"
```

## 🔄 Payment Workflow

### For Provider (MISHECK NDOLO)
```
1. Provider receives payment instructions
   └── Use reference: PCXJO71P

2. Provider makes bank deposit
   └── Nedbank Account: 1313872032
   └── Reference: PCXJO71P
   └── Amount: R150.00

3. System detects deposit (ML auto-detection or manual)
   └── Matches customer code: XJO71P
   └── Creates DepositRequest with reference: MISHECK001

4. System processes deposit
   └── Calculates credits: R150 ÷ 50 = 3 credits
   └── Creates Transaction record
   └── Updates provider balance

5. Provider receives notification
   └── 3 credits activated
   └── Can now purchase leads
```

### For Admin
```
1. Check deposits with customer code
2. Verify amount and provider
3. Approve/Process deposit
4. Credits automatically activated
```

- **Bank reference**: PC + their customer code (e.g., PCABC123)
- **Deposit references**: Unique per transaction (PROVIDER001, PROVIDER002)

### Example: New Provider "JOHN DOE"
```
Customer Code: QWE456 (auto-generated)
Bank Reference: PCQWE456
Deposit References: JOHN001, JOHN002, JOHN003, etc.
```

provider = ProviderProfile.objects.get(user__email='email@example.com')
print(f"Customer Code: {provider.customer_code}")
```

### Check Deposit with Customer Code
```python
deposits = DepositRequest.objects.filter(customer_code='XJO71P')
```

### Verify Credit Calculation
