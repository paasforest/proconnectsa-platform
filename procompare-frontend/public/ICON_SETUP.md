# PWA Icon Setup

## Current Status
The PWA manifest references icon files (`icon-192.png` and `icon-512.png`) that need to be created.

## Quick Setup (Temporary Icons)

For now, the PWA will work without icons (browsers will use defaults), but it's recommended to add proper icons.

## To Add Icons:

1. **Create icon files:**
   - `public/icon-192.png` (192x192 pixels)
   - `public/icon-512.png` (512x512 pixels)

2. **Icon requirements:**
   - Square images (1:1 aspect ratio)
   - PNG format
   - Transparent background recommended
   - Should represent ProConnectSA branding

3. **Quick generation options:**
   - Use an online icon generator
   - Export from design tool (Figma, Canva, etc.)
   - Use the "P" logo from the header as base

## Note
The PWA will function without these icons, but they improve the install experience and app appearance on home screens.
