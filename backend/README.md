# ProCompare Backend - Well-Structured Models

This document outlines the well-structured Django models organized by functionality for scalability and maintainability.

## Architecture Overview

The backend is organized into separate Django apps, each handling a specific domain:

```
backend/
├── users/           # User management and provider profiles
├── leads/           # Lead management and assignments
├── reviews/         # Review and rating system
├── notifications/   # Notification system
├── payments/        # Credit transactions and billing
└── utils/           # Shared utilities (SMS, Email services)
```

## Model Relationships

### Core Models

#### 1. Users App (`backend.users`)

**User Model**
- Extended Django AbstractUser with platform-specific fields
- Supports clients, providers, and administrators
- Includes location data and verification status
- UUID primary key for security

**ProviderProfile Model**
- One-to-one relationship with User
- Business information and verification details
- Subscription management and credit tracking
- Performance metrics and service areas

#### 2. Leads App (`backend.leads`)

**ServiceCategory Model**
- Hierarchical categories with parent-child relationships
- Supports subcategories for better organization
- Active/inactive status for category management

**Lead Model**
- Service requests from clients
- Comprehensive verification and scoring system
- Location-based matching with providers
- Status tracking through the entire workflow

**LeadAssignment Model**
- Links leads to providers
- Tracks provider actions and outcomes
- Credit management and refund handling
- Performance metrics collection

#### 3. Reviews App (`backend.reviews`)

**Review Model**
- Detailed rating system (overall + 4 specific metrics)
- Links to completed LeadAssignments
- Verification and moderation capabilities
- Public/private visibility controls

#### 4. Notifications App (`backend.notifications`)

**Notification Model**
- Multi-channel notification system (SMS, Email, Push)
- Priority levels and delivery tracking
- Action buttons and deep linking
- Bulk notification capabilities

#### 5. Payments App (`backend.payments`)

**CreditTransaction Model**
- Complete audit trail of all credit movements
- Multiple transaction types (purchase, deduction, refund, bonus)
- Status tracking and admin adjustments
- Balance calculation and history

## Key Features for Scalability

### 1. Database Indexing
- Strategic indexes on frequently queried fields
- Composite indexes for complex queries
- Foreign key indexes for join performance

### 2. UUID Primary Keys
- Security through non-sequential IDs
- Better for distributed systems
- Prevents enumeration attacks

### 3. JSON Fields
- Flexible data storage for service areas, documents, settings
- Easy to extend without schema changes
- Maintains data integrity with validation

### 4. Soft Relationships
- Uses string references for some relationships
- Reduces circular import issues
- Better for modular architecture

### 5. Comprehensive Meta Classes
- Proper ordering and verbose names
- Database constraints and indexes
- Admin interface optimization

## Service Layer Architecture

### LeadVerificationService
- Handles lead processing and verification
- SMS verification with retry logic
- Automated provider matching
- Admin notification system

### SMSService
- Panacea Mobile API integration
- South African phone number validation
- Template-based messaging
- Error handling and logging

### EmailService
- Django email integration
- HTML template support
- Multiple email types (verification, notifications, reminders)
- Development mode logging

## Data Flow

### Lead Processing Flow
1. **Lead Creation** → Client submits service request
2. **Verification** → System calculates verification score
3. **SMS Verification** → Client confirms via SMS (if needed)
4. **Provider Matching** → Find matching providers by location/service
5. **Assignment** → Assign to top providers (credit deduction)
6. **Notification** → Notify providers via SMS/Email
7. **Tracking** → Monitor provider responses and outcomes

### Credit Management Flow
1. **Purchase** → Provider buys credits
2. **Assignment** → Credits deducted for lead access
3. **Refund** → Credits refunded for bad leads
4. **Subscription** → Monthly credit allocation
5. **Tracking** → Complete audit trail maintained

## Performance Considerations

### Database Optimization
- Proper indexing strategy
- Query optimization with select_related/prefetch_related
- Pagination for large datasets
- Database connection pooling

### Caching Strategy
- Redis for session storage
- Cache frequently accessed data (service categories, provider profiles)
- Cache expensive calculations (verification scores, matching algorithms)

### Background Tasks
- Celery for async processing
- SMS/Email sending
- Lead verification processing
- Performance metrics updates

## Security Features

### Data Protection
- UUID primary keys
- Phone number validation
- Email verification
- SMS verification codes

### Access Control
- User type-based permissions
- Provider verification system
- Admin-only operations
- Audit trails for all transactions

### Input Validation
- Django validators for all fields
- Phone number regex validation
- Email format validation
- JSON field validation

## Monitoring and Analytics

### Key Metrics
- Lead conversion rates
- Provider response times
- Credit transaction volumes
- User engagement metrics

### Logging
- Comprehensive logging throughout services
- Error tracking and alerting
- Performance monitoring
- Audit trail maintenance

## Future Enhancements

### Scalability Improvements
- Database sharding for large datasets
- Microservices architecture
- API rate limiting
- CDN integration for static assets

### Feature Additions
- Real-time notifications (WebSocket)
- Advanced matching algorithms
- Machine learning for lead scoring
- Mobile app API endpoints

## Development Guidelines

### Code Organization
- Separate apps by domain
- Service layer for business logic
- Utility functions in utils package
- Signal handlers for cross-app communication

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for all models
- Integration tests for services
- API endpoint testing
- Performance testing for critical paths

### Deployment
- Environment-specific settings
- Database migrations
- Static file handling
- SSL certificate management

This architecture provides a solid foundation for a scalable, maintainable platform that can grow with your business needs.
