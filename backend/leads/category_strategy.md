- icon (CharField)
- is_active (BooleanField)

    for service in provider.services.filter(is_active=True):
        service_categories.add(service.category.slug)
        # Include parent categories
        if service.category.parent:
            service_categories.add(service.category.parent.slug)
    
    return service_category_slug in service_categories
