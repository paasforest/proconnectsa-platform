## What This Means

### ✅ Good News
1. **Pages ARE Ranking** - Getting impressions means Google is showing your pages
2. **More Impressions** - 86 impressions is much better than 7 before
3. **Content Working** - The improvements we made are helping
4. **Multiple Pages Ranking** - Not just one page, but many

### ⚠️ The Problem
1. **Still Low Positions** - 0 clicks = positions 20-50 (page 2-5)
2. **Users Don't Click** - People rarely click past page 1
3. **Need Higher Rankings** - Need positions 1-10 to get clicks

---

## Why 0 Clicks?

### Click-Through Rate by Position
- **Position 1:** 31.7% CTR
- **Position 2:** 24.7% CTR
- **Position 3:** 18.7% CTR
- **Position 4-10:** 10-15% CTR
- **Position 11-20:** 2-5% CTR
- **Position 21-30:** 0.5-1% CTR
- **Position 31-50:** 0.1-0.5% CTR ← **You are here**

**Your Position 44.6 = 0.2% CTR is NORMAL for that position**
