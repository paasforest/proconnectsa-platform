# 🚀 Deployment Summary - October 7, 2025

## Overview
All updates made today were **backend changes** deployed directly to **Hetzner server**. No frontend changes were made, so no git push to Vercel is needed.

---

## ✅ What Was Deployed to Hetzner

### 1. ML Auto-Verification System
**Files Updated on Hetzner**:
- `backend/leads/tasks.py` - Added `auto_verify_providers_ml()` task
- `backend/procompare/celery.py` - Added Celery Beat schedule (every 10 minutes)
- `backend/leads/management/commands/auto_verify_providers.py` - Management command

**Features**:
- Automatically verifies providers using ML scoring (75+ threshold)
- Assigns leads to newly verified providers
- Runs every 10 minutes via Celery Beat

---

### 2. ML Auto-Distribution Fix
**Files Updated on Hetzner**:
- `backend/leads/serializers.py` - Fixed `LeadCreateSerializer` to properly handle category
- `backend/leads/signals.py` - Added safety checks for category validation
- `backend/leads/services.py` - Added category validation in `LeadAssignmentService`

**Bug Fixed**:
- ❌ **Before**: Leads created without service_category causing ML services to fail
- ✅ **After**: Proper category validation and conversion at multiple layers

---

### 3. Payment System Corrections
**Updates Made**:
- Corrected MISHECK NDOLO's payment: R150 = 3 credits (not R500 = 50)
- Updated customer code: XJO71P (from provider profile)
- Created deposit reference: MISHECK001
- Allocated 3 credits to provider account
