# ✅ Admin Login Redirect Issue - FIXED!

## 🔧 What Was the Problem?

After logging in to the admin dashboard, you were being redirected to `https://www.proconnectsa.co.za/register` instead of staying on the admin dashboard.

### The Issue:
1. Admin login stored credentials in localStorage
2. Used `router.push('/admin/dashboard')` to redirect
3. Dashboard page loaded but localStorage hadn't fully synced yet
4. Dashboard saw "no user" and redirected to `/login`
5. `/login` page automatically redirects to `/register`
6. You ended up at the registration page!

---

## ✅ What Was Fixed?

### 1. **Changed Admin Login Redirect**
- **Before:** `router.push('/admin/dashboard')` + `router.refresh()`
- **After:** `window.location.href = '/admin/dashboard'`

**Why this works:** `window.location.href` forces a full page reload, ensuring localStorage is properly loaded before the dashboard checks authentication.

### 2. **Fixed AuthProvider Redirects**
- Updated all redirect paths to go to `/register` (the main auth page)
- Removed the chain of redirects that was causing the loop
