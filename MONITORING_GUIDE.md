# Gunicorn web server logs
ssh root@128.140.123.48 "tail -100 /var/log/gunicorn.log"

ssh root@128.140.123.48 "tail -100 /var/log/proconnectsa/error.log"
```

## Troubleshooting

### "No activity" showing but I know there are new users
- Check if time zone is correct
- Run with different hours: `?hours=48` or `?hours=168` (week)

### API returns 401 Unauthorized
- You need admin authentication token
- Create admin token or use Django admin login

### Email alerts not working
- Check `ADMIN_EMAIL` in `monitoring_signals.py`
- Verify SendGrid/email settings in `settings.py`
- Check Django logs for email errors

---

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Run `bash check_status.sh` daily to check system health
2. ‚úÖ Set up your admin email to receive alerts
3. ‚úÖ Create admin dashboard (frontend) using API endpoints
4. ‚úÖ Set up automated daily reports (cron job)
