- **File**: `backend/leads/tasks.py`
- **Function**: `auto_verify_providers_ml()`
- **Schedule**: Every 10 minutes via Celery Beat
- **Threshold**: 75+ ML score for auto-verification

### 2. ML Verification Scoring Algorithm

**Profile Completeness (40 points)**
- Email: 10 points
- Phone: 10 points
- First Name: 5 points
- Last Name: 5 points
- Service Categories: 10 points

**Service Area Coverage (20 points)**
- Service Areas: 20 points
- Multiple Areas Bonus: +5 points

**Profile Quality (20 points)**
- Multiple Services: 10 points
- Active Account: 5 points
- Account Age: 5 points

**ML Confidence Factors (20 points)**
- Email Domain Quality: 3-5 points
- Phone Format: 5 points
- Profile Age Bonus: 5-10 points

### 3. Automatic Lead Assignment
- Newly verified providers automatically receive matching leads
- Leads are assigned based on service categories and geographical areas
- ML scoring determines assignment priority
- Real-time SMS and email notifications sent

### 4. Celery Beat Schedule
```python
'auto-verify-providers-ml': {
    'task': 'backend.leads.tasks.auto_verify_providers_ml',
    'schedule': crontab(minute='*/10'),  # Every 10 minutes
},
```
